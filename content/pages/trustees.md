#Who We Are

##Founder
![alt text](images/mark-photo-bio.jpg "Mark Szymankiewicz")

Founder Mark Szymankiewicz is a Consultant Colorectal and General Surgeon based at Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. Together with wife Kate, and their three children (at the time aged 6,9,11), lived in Muheza, Tanzania for 5 months (Nov ’18 – Apr ’19) where they worked at St Augustine’s Designated District Hospital. During that time, Mark helped develop the surgical services at the hospital including setting up a sustainable mesh hernia service. Whilst firmly committed to Muheza at that time, curiosity also led him to travel the country and briefly visit other healthcare institutions, with a view to developing a better understanding of the overall healthcare system within which he worked.

Struck by the raw need, inspired by the potential, and convinced by the plausible reality, of wider surgical development in Tanzania, he engaged with the TSA (Tanzanian Surgical Association). This relationship has led to the development of our trust to help support, fund and thus enable this work.
