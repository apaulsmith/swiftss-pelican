Title: The Trust
Summary: The Trust

SWIFTSS (Surgical teams Working in Africa Together for Safer Surgery) is a UK based charity established in 2019 to help support the development of surgical services in Tanzania. Our first project is the Tanzania Mesh Hernia Project. In collaboration with the TSA (Tanzanian Surgical Association) we have the ambitious aim to establish mesh hernia surgery as the gold standard approach to inguinal hernia repair throughout Tanzania within 5 years.

## Our Goals & Principles

###To Support
It is a powerful thing when people take an interest in your work, personal well-being and development. We are also inclusive in this regard, looking towards the wider teams responsible for surgical care.

###To Educate and Train
Education lies at the heart of everything we aim to do. It is about sharing experience and expertise to help the local services develop and grow. We recognise the importance of both technical and non-technical skills, as well as other non-clinical areas for development.

###To Collaborate
The value of the individual can be dramatic, but through thoughtful collaboration so much more can be achieved.

###To Generate Funds
Financial support is crucial and determines to a large extent what can be achieved. As a charity we aim to raise funds responsibly to enable our work. We are completely transparent about our finances.

##Two-way exchange
We strongly believe that there is much to be gained by all parties in our programme. Everyone has so much to offer. Furthermore, we encourage the view that opportunity is what has created such a gap in healthcare provision and that our role is about sharing that opportunity for the benefit and well-being of all parties.
