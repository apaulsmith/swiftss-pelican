*SWIFTSS* (Surgical teams Working in Africa Together for Safer Surgery) is a UK based charity established in 2019 to help support the development of surgical services in Tanzania. Our first project is the Tanzania Mesh Hernia Project. In collaboration with the TSA (Tanzanian Surgical Association) we have the ambitious aim to establish mesh hernia surgery as the gold standard approach to inguinal hernia repair throughout Tanzania within 5 years.
